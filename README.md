This project's main application code was taken directly from [OpenAI's API Quickstart Tutorial](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart). This project's Terraform configuration files were largely based on a [tutorial put out by Hashicorp](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/kubernetes/eks). Lastly, the development of this project was made possible by Vinod Kisanagaram's tutorial on Medium, [Python App on EKS â€” From Scratch to Hosting](https://towardsaws.com/python-app-on-eks-from-scratch-to-hosting-af040f8dacf0), and the [Amazon EKS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html).
